# order-processing-practice
Practice promises and async code before Monday's deep dive into invoking APIs and sending data

## [Order processing Diagram](order-processing-diagram.PNG)

## Instructions 
- build part of our order processing system using async code
- its up to you to decide how to implement the different pieces
- some data sources are hard coded to allow easier data access
- you have a lot of freedom to make these pieces, so your test code may change as well, you are lead dev...


## Running tests
- you should not run your code directly but consume from the test file
`node order-processing.test.js`
